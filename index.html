                    My focus lately has been helping small businesses get started on the internet by designing and
                    building websites that are professional and clean, with a content-management system for their
                    website that allows them to take control of their brandâ€™s narrative.

                <h2>Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The main objective when working as a developer is to be productive and deliver value to the company.
                    As a developer or a CTO, the aim is to build practical applications that will be 100% successful. To
                    achieve this, specific goals need to be set, which include: Enhancing your networking skills.

                        technology industry all that I know and can do. I am dedicated to perfecting my craft by
                        learning from more seasoned developers, remaining humble, and continuously making strides to
                        learn all that I can about development. While a student at both Georgia Southern and Georgia
                        State Universities, I studied Mathematics, and I believe that my understanding of problem
                        solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my
                        overall success as a developer.
